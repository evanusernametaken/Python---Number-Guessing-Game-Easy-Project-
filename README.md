This repository contains a simple Python console game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, letting the user know whether their guess was too high or too low, and continues until the correct number is found or the user decides to exit.
When the game begins, a random number is generated and the user is prompted to enter a guess. Each input is checked to ensure it is either a valid number or the command to exit the game. If the input is invalid, the program reminds the user to enter a proper number and allows them to continue. Each valid guess increases the attempt counter, helping the user see how many tries it took to find the answer.
As the game progresses, the program guides the player by indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the correct number. This feedback helps maintain the challenge while making the game interactive and user-friendly. When the user finally guesses the correct number, the game displays a congratulatory message and shows how many attempts were used.
If the user chooses to quit early by typing “exit,” the program reveals the correct number and ends the game gracefully.
To play the game, run the Python script in any environment that supports standard input. The game will start automatically and guide you through the guessing process from beginning to end.
